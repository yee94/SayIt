# Meeting Notes

This document explains Voxt's Meeting Notes mode: what it does, how to configure it, which engines it supports, and what to expect from the current beta implementation.

## Overview

Meeting Notes is a separate long-running capture mode for meetings, calls, interviews, and podcasts.

- Starts with the dedicated meeting shortcut
- Opens a floating meeting card instead of the normal transcription card
- Does not paste text into the focused input
- Saves results into a dedicated `Meeting` history type
- Can open a detail window for timeline review, translation, and export

Current beta uses source-based separation:

- microphone audio is labeled as `Me`
- system audio is labeled as `Them`

This is not true diarization yet.

## How To Enable It

1. Open the main window, then go to `General > Output`
2. Turn on `Meeting Notes (Beta)`
3. Grant the required permissions:
   - microphone
   - accessibility / input monitoring for the hotkey path
   - system audio capture permission

After enabling it:

- the meeting shortcut appears in the main window's `Hotkey` page
- meeting-related permissions appear in the main window's `Permissions` page
- meeting history becomes available in History filters

## Supported ASR Engines

Meeting Notes follows the current global transcription engine.

### Whisper

- Supported
- Uses the current Whisper model
- Uses the existing Whisper `Realtime` setting
  - `Realtime ON`: lower-latency meeting updates
  - `Realtime OFF`: quality-first chunked meeting transcription

### MLX Audio

- Supported
- Uses the current MLX model
- Realtime-capable MLX models use lower-latency meeting updates
- Other MLX models use chunked meeting transcription

### Remote ASR

- Supported
- Uses the currently selected Remote ASR provider and configuration
- Meeting behavior now depends on provider family:
  - OpenAI: existing chunk pseudo-realtime path when enabled
  - Doubao ASR: uses a dedicated `Meeting ASR` model and chunk/file transcription path
  - Aliyun Bailian ASR: uses a dedicated `Meeting ASR` model and async/file transcription path
  - GLM ASR: chunked upload flow

For `Doubao ASR` and `Aliyun Bailian ASR`:

- `Meeting Notes` does not use the provider's live websocket path
- configure `Meeting ASR` separately in the main window under `Model > Remote ASR > [Provider]`
- if the meeting model is missing, meeting start is blocked
- use `Test Meeting ASR` to verify the meeting-specific request path

### Direct Dictation

- Not supported for meetings in the current beta

## Meeting Card

The meeting card is optimized for long-running capture.

- collapsible header-only mode
- pause / resume
- close with secondary confirmation
- per-segment timestamp list
- click to copy a segment
- optional realtime translation for `Them`
- live detail window

If a meeting already contains transcript content, ending it from a collapsed card will auto-expand first so the confirmation dialog is easier to use.

## Realtime Translation

Meeting realtime translation follows the app's existing translation model/provider settings.

- uses the same translation provider selection as normal translation
- uses the same fallback rules
- uses its own remembered target language for meeting mode
- translates only `Them` segments in the current UI

If the selected translation provider cannot be used directly for text translation in meeting mode, Voxt falls back through the normal resolver behavior.

## History, Detail Window, And Export

When a meeting finishes normally:

1. the meeting card closes
2. a `Meeting` history entry is saved
3. the meeting detail window opens automatically

The detail window supports:

- transcript review
- timestamp-based navigation
- translation on existing meeting segments
- export when the current mode allows it

## Notes And Limitations

- Current beta is source-based (`Me` / `Them`), not full speaker diarization
- Meeting mode is isolated from normal transcription / translation / rewrite sessions
- Meeting mode uses a dedicated history type and detail flow
- Cold local-model startup can still take time on first use; Voxt shows model initialization state in the overlay
- For remote providers, Voxt keeps the meeting UI uniform, but transport differs by provider capability:
  - `Doubao` / `Aliyun` meetings use provider-specific chunk/file transcription models
  - other providers stay on their existing chunk-based meeting path
