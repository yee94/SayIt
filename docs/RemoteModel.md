# Remote Models

Voxt lets you choose separate remote providers for `Remote ASR` and `Remote LLM`. This document only introduces the providers and model ranges currently built into the app, so you can understand what each option is for first. Setup steps such as API key creation, endpoint configuration, and model selection guidance can be expanded in later sections.

## ASR Models

### OpenAI Whisper

- Suggested default: `whisper-1`
- Built-in models: `whisper-1`, `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`, `gpt-4o-transcribe`
- Overview: Best for general-purpose multilingual audio transcription. Voxt currently integrates it as file-based transcription, which makes it a good fit for users who want compatibility and a stable experience.
- Voxt note: this provider also supports custom model IDs and custom OpenAI-compatible transcription endpoints.

- [Website](https://openai.com/)
- [API Docs](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/audio)
- [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

Endpoint: `https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions`  
Key: `$OPENAI_API_KEY`

Compatible custom endpoint examples:

- [MOSI Studio MOSS Transcribe](https://studio.mosi.cn/docs/moss-transcribe)
  - Endpoint: `https://studio.mosi.cn/api/v1/audio/transcriptions`
  - Models: `moss-transcribe`, `moss-transcribe-diarize`
- [Groq Speech-to-Text](https://console.groq.com/docs/speech-to-text)
  - Endpoint: `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/audio/transcriptions`
  - Models: `whisper-large-v3-turbo`, `whisper-large-v3`

Important notes:

- In Voxt, custom ASR model IDs are supported only through the `OpenAI Whisper` provider.
- Enter the full transcription endpoint, not just the API root.
- Voxt uses file upload transcription for this provider path. If a compatible service also supports URL or Base64 inputs, Voxt still uses file upload.
- If a compatible service returns extra structured metadata such as diarization segments, Voxt currently reads the transcript text but does not surface that metadata as a dedicated UI feature.

### GLM ASR

- Suggested default: `glm-asr-1`
