# Rewrite

This document explains Voxt's rewrite feature: what it does, how it differs from standard transcription and translation, and how to configure it well.

## Overview

Rewrite is the voice-driven prompt / rewrite flow in Voxt.

Default shortcut: `fn+control`

It turns your speech into an instruction, then uses the configured rewrite model to:

- rewrite selected text
- generate new text from a spoken instruction
- keep a stable answer card when direct text insertion is not appropriate

## Two Main Modes

### Rewrite Selected Text

If text is currently selected, your spoken instruction is applied to that source text.

Examples:

- “Make this shorter and smoother.”
- “Rewrite this in a more formal tone.”
- “Turn this into bullet points.”

### Generate From Voice Prompt

If nothing is selected, your spoken instruction becomes the prompt itself.

Examples:

- “Help me write a 200-word self introduction.”
- “Draft a short project update for my manager.”

## Model And Provider Selection

Rewrite follows the rewrite model/provider settings in the main window's `Model` page.

Current rewrite providers:

- local Custom LLM
- Remote LLM

Rewrite does not use ASR provider settings for the generation step; ASR is only used to convert your speech into the rewrite instruction.

## Prompt Behavior

Rewrite uses the dedicated rewrite prompt.

- you can customize it in the main window
- the spoken instruction becomes part of the rewrite request
- selected text, if present, is passed in as source material

Voxt also applies the normal enhancement chain to the dictated instruction before the rewrite step when appropriate.

## App Enhancement And Rewrite

When `App Enhancement` is enabled, rewrite can become context-aware.

- Voxt can switch prompts and rules based on the current app or browser URL
- the same rewrite shortcut can behave differently in coding tools, chat apps, email, or docs
- this is especially useful when you want different rewrite tone, formatting, or terminology by context

`App Enhancement` does not replace rewrite itself. It changes the prompt routing and context that rewrite uses.

## Rewrite Answer Card

Rewrite can keep the result visible in an answer card instead of relying only on direct text insertion.

This is useful when:

- the current target is not writable
- the generated result is long
- you want to review the answer before using it

## Tips

- Be explicit about style, length, and output format
- For selected-text rewrite, mention what should change, not just the topic
- For prompt-style generation, say what you want written and any constraints

## Notes

- Rewrite is a separate flow from normal transcription and translation
- It can reuse the same local or remote LLM infrastructure, but with its own prompt and output behavior
- Result quality depends strongly on the chosen model and the clarity of the spoken instruction
